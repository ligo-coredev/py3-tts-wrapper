# Introduction

TTS Wrapper is a powerful Python library that provides a unified interface for working with multiple Text-to-Speech (TTS) services. Whether you're using cloud-based services like AWS Polly, Google Cloud TTS, or local solutions like eSpeak, TTS Wrapper makes it easy to integrate and switch between different TTS engines.

## Key Features

- **Unified Interface**: One consistent API for multiple TTS services
- **SSML Support**: Rich text-to-speech markup language support
- **Streaming Capabilities**: Real-time audio streaming and playback
- **Extensive Engine Support**: Works with major cloud providers and local TTS engines
- **Advanced Audio Control**: Pause, resume, and stop functionality
- **Word-Level Timing**: Precise word boundary information for supported engines
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Why TTS Wrapper?

TTS Wrapper was created to solve common challenges in text-to-speech integration:

1. **Simplified Integration**: Instead of learning multiple APIs, learn one interface that works with all supported engines.
2. **Easy Engine Switching**: Change TTS engines with minimal code changes.
3. **Consistent Features**: Access advanced features like SSML and word timing across supported engines.
4. **Cross-Platform Support**: Work with both cloud and local TTS solutions across different operating systems.
